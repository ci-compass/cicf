# A Quick Tour of Jupyter

First, congratulations!  You've successfully navigated to a Jupyter
notebook and opened it.

Jupyter is a convenient and productive way to **keep notes and code
together**. Think of it as being like a regular old paper Lab
Notebook, except this notebook can have runnable code in it that can be
**run directly from the notebook**.

A Jupyter notebook consists of a bunch of _cells_ which contain either
code or text (in [Markdown] format) and its output.  In CICF examples
we are likely to use Python code (unless there is a change of mind),
but it is possible to use other programming languages also in Jupyter
notebooks.

(A fun fact: the name Jupyter is an amalgamation of [Julia], Python,
and [R] -- the three programming languages originally supported by
Jupyter.)

The code in the notebooks is _runnable_, directly from the browser
window.  You can select a python cell and then choose the menu option
"Cell > Run Cells".  Follow the text along, and try out the
instructions to run the code present in the notebook.

Notice that a notebook is made up of a series of cells that start at
the top and go down. In a sense, it's laid out a bit like a one-column
spreadsheet.

Let's start our very first explorations in Jupyter, beginning in the
next cell. It may not be obvious yet that it's a cell, but soon that
will change. For now, just keep reading.

## The Canonical "Hello World" Example

There isn't actually any law that requires the first programming
example in a language to be the "Hello World" program, but that is the
tradition, and let us stick with the tradition.

Writing a program that just prints out "Hello World" is really easy in
Python. It's just one line of code: call the "print" function with an
argument that has the string "Hello, World" in it. That line runs and
the words are printed on the screen. Super simple. Look in the next
cell down to see this one line "program".

```{python}
print("Hello, World")
```

Look at the line above. That's our print statement and its one
argument. Over a little bit to the left of it we see a pair of square
brackets. The brackets don't have anything in them, but that will
change soon.

Let us run that line of code. Looking at the cell, we see the print
statement. Click on that print statement so the blinking cursor is in
that cell. Now go to the "Run" menu and select "Run Selected Cell".
You can also use the keys Shift+Enter to run the current cell.  We
only selected the one cell, so it'll only run that one.

Did you see that?  Our Jupyter Notebook just ran that line of Python!
The output from the print function appears right below the input part
of the cell. The words "Hello World" appeared.  

Also, the square brackets now contain the number 1.  This is the
cell's execution count.  The execution count will increase every time
you run the cell.

Let's do something slightly more interesting now. Take a look at the
next cell. Then scroll down to the cell after that, where it says
"Basics of running a cell".

```{python}
drink_can_ounces = 12
total_milliliters = drink_can_ounces * 29.5735
print(total_milliliters)
```

## Basics of Running a Cell

Let's run the cell right above and see how many milliliters of soda
water are in the twelve-ounce can I'm looking at. Click in that cell,
and then this time press and hold the Shift key down and hit
Enter. We'll call this "Shift+Enter" for convenience.

A couple of things happened. First, the code executed. A variable was
set equal to 12, then it was multiplied by 29.5735 to convert those
ounces to milliliters. Finally, the last line prints out the results
of that conversion.

The second thing that happened was more subtle. Look at the text in
the square brackets to the left of it. Inside those brackets there is
now a number -- probably a "2", but the important part is that there's
a number.

Make a mental note what that number is.

Click on that cell again and hit Shift+Enter once more. The contents
of that cell runs once more and it prints out 354.882 again. And this
time, the blue number in brackets off to the left went up by one.

Jupyter keeps track of the total number of times any of the cells in a
notebook have run. When a cell is run (also called "executed"), the
total execution count goes up by one and is printed inside that cell's
brackets.

Why is this important? One of the handy things about Jupyter is that
you can run cells in any order, not just top-to-bottom. By looking at
the numbers in brackets, you can tell what order the cells were run
in. This can be handy when you're jumping around.

## Kinds of Cells

By now you may have noticed two distinct kinds of cells in a
notebook. Cells like this one with text in them are "Markdown"
cells. Cells with code in them are "Code" cells. There are other kinds
of cells (there is an extension that lets us put video in a cell, for
instance) but Code and Markdown are the most important ones for now.

In the Ancient Times, when the earth's crust was still cooling and
publications were printed on paper, an editor would go through a
manuscript, fix any errors, and then put in some little marks and
notes for the typesetter. These symbols would tell the person doing
the typesetting that some of this text should be in bold, and some of
this in italics, and would maybe have a scribbled note saying to
indent the following paragraph differently. The process of the editor
making all these notations was called "marking up" the manuscript.

Once we started using computers for this kind of thing, the term
"marking up" was shortened to "markup", and dozens of different
"markup languages" were invented that would be embedded into text
files. These "markup files" were then processed ("run off") and the
processed result could be printed.

It's hard to overstate how nice this was, compared to typewriters and
typesetting machines anyway.

You're probably familiar with at least one markup language - Hypertext
Markup Language, aka "HTML". This is a language that expresses how web
pages are laid out.

Jupyter uses another markup language, and this one is called
[Markdown]. Other things use Markdown, also. Reddit supports Markdown
(alongside what they call the "Fancy Pants Editor") and GitHub uses
[GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm].

Did you notice how this cell has a heading that says "Kinds of Cells"
and that it's in a larger font than the rest of it?  When I typed that
line, I started it with a pair of `#` symbols, like this:

```
## Kinds of Cells
```

When you "run" a cell that has Markdown text in it, Jupyter processes
the Markdown instructions in it and produces nicely-formatted output.

Let's do that for ourselves!

Click somewhere in this cell to make it the "current" cell that we're
working with. Now add a new cell right below here. On the "Insert"
menu select "Insert Cell Below" and, a lot like a spreadsheet, it will
create a new cell for us right below this one.  Newly created cells
default to being Code cells. Let's change that new one to a Markdown
cell. Go to the Cell menu, look in the "Cell Type" submenu, and select
"Markdown". Jupyter now knows the cell will contain Markdown-formatted
text instead of executable code.

In that new cell, enter the following Markdown text:

```
# This is a Level 1 Heading

## This is a Level 2 heading.

This sentence has a **bold** word and an _italicized_ one.
```

It's important to have a space between the "#" symbols and the first
word of your heading.

As you enter text and Markdown commands, Jupyter will give you sort of
a "preview" of what to expect. Once you're done entering the text, hit
Shift+Enter.  Presto!  That Markdown text has been neatly formatted
and looks rather nice.

Writing code in a cell is just as easy as Markdown text. Make this the
current cell (click on it) and add another cell below this one (using
the `+` on the tool bar, or by pressing `B` key).  The new cell will
default to being a code cell. Add the following code in the new cell:

```
x = 4
y = 6
z = 2*x + y
print(z)
```

When you have that typed in, hit Shift+Enter to execute it.

Running that code will cause it to print `14`.

## Next Steps

You have learned how to open Jupyter notebooks, how to run code that's
contained in them, and how to add your own Code and Markdown cells.

In the next notebook, we will look at the Python programming language.
