# A Quick Tour of Python

In this notebook, we'll look at some of the language features of
python and how to use them.  Some prior programming experience might
be useful here, with Java, Javascript, C, C++, or Python.

In the [previous notebook](./1-introduction.ipynb), we ran a print
statement and did some basic arithmetic, and that was our first steps
with running some Python code in Jupyter.

## A note about the REPL

You would be able to run the code examples in this notebook right here
in the notebook itself.  There's another way to quickly try out code,
even if you are not running a notebook: you can use Python's shell, or
REPL (or "Read-Eval-Print Loop").

In your virtual machine's terminal, you can run the command `python3`,
and you can enter code in the resulting prompt.

![](./slides/img/repl-hello.png)

You can also launch a terminal from Jupyter's menu (File -> New ->
Terminal), and run `python3` command there.

You do not have to use the REPL right now, but its existence and use
is a basic thing that would be useful to know.  It should be part of
any tour of Python.

Now let us look at some Python code examples.

## A few examples

Click in the next cell with the example code and press `Shift+Enter`
keys to run it.

```{python}
prius_weight = 4000
battery_weight = 150
just_the_normal_car_weight = prius_weight - battery_weight

print ("If you took the battery out of a Prius it would weigh", just_the_normal_car_weight, "pounds.")
```

It should be obvious what the code above does.  Python has all the
usual arithmetic "operators" you would expect:

```{python}
sum = 4 + 2
difference = 4 - 2
product = 4 * 2
thingie = 9 / 3

print(sum, difference, product, thingie)
```

There are also some other operators:

```{python}
integer_division = 7 // 2
remainder = 7 % 2
big_number  = 9 ** 25

print(integer_division, remainder, big_number)
```

The `//` operator (two slashes next to each other) mean "divide this
and ignore the remainder". The `%` operator means "divide this and
**only** give us the remainder.  Finally, two asterisks mean "evaluates
the left side raised to the right side's power".

The standard order of operations that we learned in school still
applies here. Exponentiation is done first, then the multiplications
and divisions, and then finally the additions and subtractions.

Within the same level, operators are evaluated left-to-right:

```{python}
print(8 - 5 + 3)
```

There is an exception, though. Exponentiation is done right-to-left:

```{python}
print(2 ** 3 ** 4)
print(2 ** 81)
```

Notice how big those numbers are?  Python (at least, all modern
versions) represent integers with 64 bits. This will hold numbers from
positive to negative 9 billion, give or take a little. If you
want to count the atoms in a micromole, knock yourself out.

Parentheses work as expected for explicitly forcing a particular order
of operations:

```{python}
test_1 = 92
test_2 = 90
test_average = (test_1 + test_2) / 2
print(test_average)
```

## Some shortcut operators

Python has a shortcut for using the value of variable, changing it,
and storing it back in the same variable.  So the code in both the
below cells do the same thing:

```{python}
weight = 6
weight = weight + 4
print(weight)

```

```{python}
weight = 6
weight += 4
print(weight)
```

Along with the `+=` operator, there is also `-=`, `*=`, and `/=`.

## The `print()` function

We've been throwing those `print()` function calls around without
talking about them. 

The `print()` function will take any number of arguments, separated by
commas, and print them out with one space between them. After the last
item is printed, Python will put out a "newline" character, go to the
next line, and get ready to start printing at the beginning of the
next line.

## Variables

Variables give names to things. We've seen variables used as integers
and as floating point numbers.  Variables can also refer to strings.

Unlike Java or C++, they are not "strongly" typed.  A variable can be a
number one moment and then can suddenly become a string.  You don't
have to declare types of variables either.

```{python}
amount = 7
print(amount)
amount = "a whole lot!"
print(amount)
```

Variables in Python work similarly to Javascript, if you're familiar
with that language.

## Basic data types

Python has these basic data types:

- Booleans, which are `True` or `False` values.
- Numbers, which can be:
  - Integers (example: `-1`, `0`, `1`, `2`, …)
  - Floating point numbers (example: `3.14`)
  - Complex numbers (example: `3+4j`)
- Strings (example: `"hello world!"`)
- `None`, which is a special constant that indicates the absence of a
  value. `None` is the equivalent of `null` in some other
  languages. When you call a function and it returns nothing, you will
  get a `None`, for example.

There also [decimal] numbers and [fractions], should you ever need
them.  You can take a look at Python's [Numeric and Mathematical
Modules][numeric] if you are curious what else is available.

[decimal]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
[fractions]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html
[numeric]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html

We will discuss modules later.  For now, just bear in mind that: (1) a
"module" is some code that you can use when writing your own code, and
(2) Python has a standard library, which is a collection of useful and
commonly used modules.  You will use the standard library a lot if you
use Python.

### Strings

Strings can be surrounded by single quotes (`'`) or double quotes
(`"`). Whichever one you start a string with, you have to end with
that same kind, and it does not matter which kind of quote you use:
`'hello'` and `"hello"` are the same.

```{python}
'hello' == "hello"
```

Note that you can't mix the types of quotes when declaring a string.
Running the below code cell will result in an error:

```{python}
'hello"
```

Regardless of the type of quote you use, it would be a good idea to
use one type of quotes consistently across a program or project.

## Built-in data structures

Some data structures are immediately available to you in the core
language:

- Lists 
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

### Lists

Here is an example of a list:

```{python}
temperatures = [44.2, 43.6, 107.9, "awfully hot!"]
```

You write the elements of the list inside square brackets (`[` and
`]`), with commas to separate them.

Python lists are like arrays in C++ and Java, except:

- Python lists can grow (and shrink) as needed.
- The different elements of an array do not all have to be the same
  type.
  
Here's another example:

```{python}
grades = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "F"]
print(len(grades))

print(grades[0])
print(grades[1])
print(grades[2])
print(grades[3])
print(grades[4])
```

Notice the first element in a list is numbered 0 (zero).  Any time you
index into a list, Python always counts starting at 0,
not 1. Forgetting this fact will likely be a big source of mistakes.

You can also loop over lists using a `for` statement (we will discuss
`for` statements later in this notebook):

```{python}
for grade in grades:
    print(grade)
```

If you try to read past a list, that would result in an error. Try
running the below cell:

```{python}
grades[5]
```

Lists are one-dimensional. If you would normally use a 2D array for
something, you would want to use a list of lists:

```{python}
list_of_lists = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [],
    [4, 5, 6]
]
print(list_of_lists[1])
```

`[]` is an empty list, obviously.


### Dictionaries

Dictionaries (or `dict` objects in Python parlance) contain pairs of
keys and values.  You will use them when you want to look up items by
a key whose value you already know.

```{python}
drugs = { 
   "asprin": 325, 
   "acetaminophen": 500 
}
print(drugs["asprin"])
print(drugs["acetaminophen"])
```

If you try to look up by a key that does not exist, that would result
in an error:

```{python}
drugs["ibuprofen"]
```

In order to avoid the error, you can do something like this:

```{python}
value = drugs.get("ibuprofen")
if value != None:
    print("Found ibuprofen:", value)
else:
    print("Could not find ibuprofen")
```

You can add new keys and values to an existing dictionary:

```{python}
drugs["methotrexate"] = 2.5
print(drugs)
```

Keys in a dictionary are immutable: you can't change them once they
are inserted.  But you can change the values associated with them:

```{python}
drugs["methotrexate"] = 3.5
print(drugs)
```


### Tuples

Tuples (or `tuple` objects) construct groups of objects.  These are
all tuples:

```{python}
()               # An empty tuple.
(1,)             # A one-item tuple.
(0, 'Ni', 3.14)  # A four item tuple.
```

Unlike lists, tuples are immutable: you can't change a tuple's
elements once the tuple is constructed.  You can use tuples when you
need to:

- Use a collection of things that remains constant.
- Return multiple values from a function. (We'll discuss functions
  later.)

Tuples can be dictionary keys because they are immutable.

```{python}
locations = {
    (40.7128, -74.0060): "New York",
    (51.5074, -0.1278): "London"
}
```

The strings that start with `#` are comments.  We will discuss
comments later in this notebook.

### Sets

Sets (or `set` objects) are structures whose elements are unique.

```{python}
{1,2,3}
{0, 'Ni', 3.14}
```

If you want to get just the unique elements of a list, you can insert
the list to a set!

```{python}
numbers = [10,1,1,1,1,2,20]
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)
```

## Operator overloading

Operators can have different meaning depending on the types of data
they operate on.

For example, the `+` operator applied to numbers will result in an
addition.  When applied to strings, the `+` operator will concatenate
("jam together") them.

```{python}
first_part = "super"
other_part = "conducting"
supreme_coolness = first_part + other_part
print(supreme_coolness)
```

Notice that it did not insert a space. If you need a space, you have
to do it yourself.

```{python}
not_as_cool = first_part + " " + other_part
print(not_as_cool)
```

### A couple of things to notice

First, there are three things being concatenated: a variable, a string
"literal" with only a single space in it, and another
variable. Second, when we evaluate a cell and create a variable in it,
those variables become available to every cell further down the line.

(If you're curious, there is one instance of Python running behind the
scenes. Jupyter just crams code into when you execute a cell. When
Python is done running that, any output is put into the notebook right
below that block. Running another command later, in another cell,
sends that code to the one and only Python instance associated with
the entire notebook. There is no need to write insanely long cells,
and in fact you should keep them 30-50 lines at most if you
can. Shorter cells are easier to understand and debug.

## Control flow

Python has the same control structures you're used to, such as `if`
and `if`/`else`.  It's just that syntax may be a little different now.

```{python}
if 5 > 4 :
    print("arithmetic still works!")
    print("now back to the show!")
else:
    print("it appears we have shifted universes for a few minutes.")
    print("I have a feeling this will be bad.")
```

Notice that there **is** a `:` (colon) at the end of the `if` line. A
colon indicates that a "code block" is coming up. In our case, these
blocks are two lines long. They have to be indented, and they have to
be indented the same amount. In Python, indentation has meaning. The
"visual" level that things are indented to indicates the "lexical"
level of the code block.

### Loops

Python has loops, as expected:

```{python}
weight = 6.0

while weight < 11.2:
    print("running inside the loop!")
    weight = weight + 4

print("done with the loop now.")
```

`while` loops are very versatile: you can test anything to see if you
should continue.  Sometimes you know how many times you want to do
something and you want a cleaner way to express that.  You would use a
`for` loop in such instances.

```{python}
for i in range(1,6):
    print(i)
    
if i == 5:
    print("we got to 5, like we expected!! Surprise!!")
else:
    print("hmmm...")
```

Notice something above: when testing for equality, Python uses `==`
operator.  This is just like Java, C, C++, etc.

Notice something else: in `range(1,6)` we specified the range to be
from 1 to 6, but it stopped after 5. That's how `range()` works: you
specify the number to start at and the number that is the first one
you want it to stop at. Forgetting this will result in some
easy-to-make mistakes.

## `for` loops over lists

Back to `for` loops for a minute. These loops can also iterate over a
list:

```{python}
for color in ["red", "green", "blue"] :
    print(color)
```

In fact, the `range()` function is used to build a list of values and
then the `for` loop steps over it.


## Functions

A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a certain task.
When you find yourself writing the same pieces of code over and over,
you would "refactor" the pieces of repeating code, and put them in a
function.  Now you can call the function over and over.

Here's how you would create (or "define") a function: use the `def`
keyword, followed by a space and then the name of the function,
followed by the function parameters (or arguments), followed by a `:`,
and then the block of code that should perform the thing that you want
the function to perform.  If you want to return some value from the
function, you would use the `return` keyword.

When you want to pass more than one parameter to the function, you
would separate them by commas.

Here's an example of a function:

```{python}
import math  # use Python's math module.

def area_of_circle(radius):
    """
    Compute area of a circle.

    :param radius: radius of the circle.
    """
    result = math.pi * radius ** 2
    return result
```

You can call the function like so:

```{python}
area_of_circle(10)
```

There are two new things here: `import` statements, and code comments.
Let us talk about code comments in the next section.  We will talk
about `import` statements and importing modules in a later section.


## Code comments

Did you notice the lines in the cell above that started with a `#`?

That `#` character means "everything on the rest of the line is just a
note to myself and should not be run". These comments are very
valuable for reminding yourself (or other readers of your code) about
what's going on when you come back to your code three months later and
you can't remember anything.  You would use `#` when your comment can
be written in one line.

You can also write comments that span multiple lines: you would start
the comment with a `"""`, write the comments, and then use another
`"""` to end the comment.

Note the comment surrounded by `"""` that describe the function in
(somewhat) detail.  They are called docstrings, and this is a common
way to document Python code.

When you read the documentation of some libraries (such as NumPy
[numpy-reference]), you might be looking at pages generated by
processing docstrings that are written along with the code. Python has
conventions for writing docstrings, and tools for generating such
documentation from docstrings.

[numpy-reference]: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html


## Classes

Python classes can't be too strange to those familiar with C++ or
Java.  You would use the `class` keyword to define classes, and an
(optional) `__init__()` method (or member function) to create the
class constructor.  Note that the first parameter to member functions
is the `self` keyword.

```{python}
class Customer:
    """ An example class. """
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        """
        Constructor.

        :param name: name of the customer.
        :param address: address of the customer.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.address = address

    def show(self):
        """ Print the customer's details. """
        print(self.name + " lives at " + self.address)
```

Now you can create objects of the class, and invoke member functions
of these object:

```{python}
c = Customer("Bob", "1234 Wooded Way")
c.show()
```

We can't go into all the details here, but some basic familiarity with
the idea of classes and objects would be helpful when programming with
Python. Important data structures `list`, `dict`, `set`, and `tuple`
are implemented as classes.


## Error handling with exceptions

Consider the code below:

```{python}
total_grams = 100
number_of_people = 0
individual_portion = total_grams / number_of_people
```

If you run the above cell, it would result in an error, since division
by zero is undefined.

When an unrecoverable error such as the above occurs, the Python
runtime "raises" (or "throws") an exception.  In the above instance,
you would see an exception called `ZeroDivisionError`.  There are
other kinds of exceptions too. You also can create your own exception
classes because doing so is sometimes useful.

Unless exceptions are "caught" by an exception handler, your program
would exit or behave in ways that you do not want.  In order to do
that, you would use a `try`/`except` block, like so:

```{python}
try:
  individual_portion = total_grams / number_of_people
except:
  print("Number of people was zero, no valid answer!")
```

## Modules

We already saw how to use an external definition like `math.pi` when
we talked about functions: you do an `import math`, and then use the
code in `math` module with `math.pi`.

But what are modules?

Modules are the _organizational units_ of a Python program.  When you
create a Python project, you would split your code into logical units,
called _modules_.  You can create and use modules within your own
programs, and you can use modules from external libraries.

In concrete terms, modules correspond to files.  You would put code
that does related things in separate files, somewhat like so:

```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
    subpackage/
        __init__.py
        submodule1.py
```

And then you will be able to use these modules elsewhere by importing
them.  You would use `import` statements to do this, like so:

```python
from mypackage import module1
from mypackage.subpackage import submodule2 as sm2

module1.some_function()
sm2.some_other_function()
```

As shown above, the `as` keyword lets you import modules under a more
convenient (perhaps shorter) name.

An alternative, but more verbose syntax for importing modules would be
this:

```python
import mypackage

mypackage.module1.some_function()
mypackage.subpackage.submodule1.some_other_function()
```

The first way is a little more convenient.


## Next steps

Now you know just enough Python to be dangerous. 

An excellent [Python tutorial][tutorial] is available at
https://docs.python.org/.  I recommend you bookmark that for handy
reference.

[tutorial]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

Now that we're at least a threat to ourselves, if not others, let's go
to the [next notebook](./3-python-packages.ipynb) and look at Python
packages.
