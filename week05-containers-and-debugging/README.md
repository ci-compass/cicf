# CICF Week 5

The goals for week 5 lab are:

1. Make and run a simple Docker image.
1. Run a service packaged in an external Docker image.
1. Use the Python debugger (pdb).

## Tutorial

First, install Docker

```
$ sudo apt update
$ ./install-docker.sh
```

You will need to then enter your password for sudo and press `Y` to
agree to installing the packages.
Then we need to add us to the Docker group.
(You can type `$USER`, the shell will expand the variable to be the current username).

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Now, **choose "Log Out..." from the menu in the upper right corner and
then sign back in** to get the group membership to be cached.

Log back in, and docker should be set up.
We can verify this by running

```
docker ps
```

This lists all the containers that are currently running.
There should be no containers running, but the important thing is
that there are no errors.

### Build an image

Our first task is to create a container image.
The `Dockerfile-hello` contains the instructions on how to build the
image.

```
cat Dockerfile-hello
```

We start with the official base python image, we copy in our script,
and then we specify the command to run when the container is
started.
(Don't forget the period at the end!)

```
docker build -t hello -f Dockerfile-hello .
```

This is making an image from that instruction file and we are naming
the image `hello`.

```
docker images
```

And then to run the image we use:

```
docker run hello
```

We can see the layers, (i.e. sequence of commands to make the image)
with the "history" command:

```
docker history hello
```

The most recent change is at the top and the oldest change is at the
bottom.

We can see the all containers (whether running or not) with the
`-a` option on the `ps` command:

```
docker ps -a
```

Okay, let's see if the execution environment is really restricted:

```
docker run -it hello bash
```

This has less of everything:

```
env
ping
python3
```

Also, by default, containers have no network access.


### Object Store

We are going to run a service using docker.

This is something called an object store, which we will visit when we
talk about cloud computing.  For now the important thing is that we
will run it inside a container.

First, get the container image:

```
docker pull minio/minio
```

See that it has been downloaded:

```
docker images
```

We will now run it.  This looks complicated since we need to pass some
configuration on the command line.  By default containers don't have
network access, so we first need to tell docker to allow us to access
this container on ports 9000 and 9001.

We then need to configure where we want the service to store data.
And we need to configure a root user and password.

```
mkdir -p data

docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v $(pwd)/data:/data -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=cicf" -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=cicf1234" minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

The container should have started and be running in the background.
Docker printed the ID for this container.  We will let `{id}` refer to
the first few letters/digits of this id.

```
docker ps
docker logs {id}
```

Okay, let's set it up. In the web browser, visit `http://localhost:9001`
Sign in with our username and password `cicf` and `cicf1234` Create a new
bucket named "cicf-data".

Create a new access key named "test-account".  Download the secret
info and move it into our current directory:

```
mv ~/Downloads/credentials.json .
```

The file is in JSON format.

```
cat credentials.json
```

Aside: there is a great tool for working with JSON files.

```
sudo apt install jq
jq . credentials.json
```

Grant the new key sufficient access privileges.  Copy the `minio-policy`
policy file:

```
cat minio-policy
```

Edit the key we just created by pasting in the file contents.  And then
save it.

Now upload some files.  We want `hello.py`.

We will install the Python [minio] library.  We created a virtual
environment in the home directory for installing Python packages
earlier in week 2.  We will reuse that environment here:

[minio]: https://pypi.org/project/minio/

```
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

Now we can install the `minio` Python package inside that virtual
environment:

```
pip3 install minio
```

Copy the credentials into the store.py file.  Run `store.py`.  Refresh
the bucket, nothing should have happened.  

Now upload the `fib-first` file to the bucket and rerun `store.py`.
Refresh the bucket, there should be a new object named `result-first`
It should contain the 16th Fibonacci number, which is 987.

The name is not quite right.  Let's put a breakpoint into the file
Before line 25 insert the line `breakpoint()`.

When we run the script, it will stop in the debugger.  We can see
variables with `p` prefix.  There are three ways to advance execution:
stepping, next, or continuing. Step will take the smallest possible
increase, in that it will go into functions and stop.  Next will stop
at the next line of the program.  Continue will keep running until
another breakpoint or until the program ends.

- [Python pdb debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)
- [Reprozip](https://www.reprozip.org/) is a cool tool that will watch
  a program run (using the strace mechanism) and then save all the
  files opened and their contents into a zip file. It then has the
  ability to create a container from the zip file.

  system, like Docker, that is more common in High Performance
  Computing envrionments.
