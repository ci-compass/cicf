# CICF

This repository contains the hands-on tutorials and auxiliary material for the
[CI Compass Fellowship](https://ci-compass.org/student-fellowships/) technical
course.

Videos and Slides are available to fellows on the shared CICF drive.

## Course Details

CICF is divided into two parallel themes which run over the entire semester:
the technical course and the research course.
The technical course presents elements of cyberinfrastructure (CI),
with the intention of introducing students with topics that are important
to working with CI at NSF Major Facilities, but which are not typically covered
in university classes.
Naturally, this is a very diverse set of topics, so each will be covered in an introductory manner.
Links will be provided should you like to go into more depth on a topic.

For the technical class students are expected to do the following each week:

* Watch the technical lecture video for the week
* Do the technical exercises for that week
* Come to class with questions and ready to talk about their work on the exercises

The instructors are eager to help you with understanding the material and are happy to answer questions, both in class and aschronosly between classes.

## Structure of this repository

Each week has a subdirectory in this repository containing a README for that week, a test script, and some exercise scripts.
You will be expected to complete the exercises, which will involve either completing or debugging some code.
The test script will evaluate the exercises for correctness.
This will let you evaluate your solutions on your own time before that week's technical session.
In the technical session we will discuss the exercises for the week, ask and answer questions, and have students present on their solutions.

In addition to the subdirectories for each week, there is also a [getting started][started] directory that
contains instructions for setting your computer up for the class.
