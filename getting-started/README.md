Getting Started
---------------

To provide a consistent environment for everyone, we will use GitHub Codespaces.
This provides a free, web-based virtual machine that has a command line.

1. If you don't have one already, sign up for a (free) GitHub account.
2. Fork this repository (ci-compass/cicf). This will make you a personal copy of it.
3. Start a codespace for this repository.

## Signing up for GitHub account

If you don't have a GitHub account create one at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
Accounts are free.

**Please send an email to `cicf@ci-compass.org` telling us your GitHub user name.**

## Fork this repository

Sign in to your account on GitHub and then visit this repository's page, [ci-compass/cicf](https://github.com/ci-compass/cicf).
Choose the "Fork" drop down on the upper right of the page, and then make a fork of the repository
into your own space, so the owner will be your account and keep the repository name `cicf`.
After some time you will have your own copy of the CICF repository.

## Start a Codespace for this repository

Choose the big plus sign `+` allong the top right of the screen and then "create a new Codespace" from the dropdown menu.
Base the codespace on this repository (so `ci-compass/cicf`),
on the main branch,
and use the default configuration, region and machine type.
You may see a message that the "Codespace usage for this repository is paid for by ...".
Do not worry, the code space is free.

After selecting "Create Codespace", a virtual machine is created and a window should open.
The window provides a web-based interface to your codespace.
It should look like the following screenshot.
![Picture of codespace window](./codespace-marked.png)
In the screenshot a few regions are marked in red.
There is a file pane, which lists the files in the virtual machine;
an editor pane where you can edit files (in the screenshot nothing is being edited, so nothing is displayed);
and at the bottom there is a prompt that should look similar to `@dbrower ➜ /workspaces/cicf (main) $`,
this is the terminal window.

You can make the terminal window larger by choosing the "full screen" button on the termal pane.
You can also hide the file pane using the panel controls.

## Using the Codespace

The code space will exist, even if you should close the browser window.
The URL to the codespace is persistent, so you can bookmark it.
You can also find it again by signing in to GitHub and then from the hamburger menu in the top left corner choose "Codespaces" and then at the bottom of the page you will see a list of all your active Codespaces. You can click it to open another window to it.
