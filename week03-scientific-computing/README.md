# CICF Week 3

This week is a hands-on guide working in a supercomputing environment at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://tacc.utexas.edu/).


# Resources

* HPC Carpentry [Introduction to High-Performance Computing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/)
* News article on design of a new HPC system at TACC: [With Vista, TACC now has three paths to its future horizon superomputer (2024)](https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/01/29/with-vista-tacc-now-has-three-paths-to-its-future-horizon-supercomputer/)
* [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) distributed scientific computing
* [SETI@Home](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/) is the original distributed computing project. No longer distributing tasks, though.
* TACC's [Frontera User Guide](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/frontera/)

For SSH

- GitHub [How to make an SSH keypair](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)


**Networking Performance Links**

* [Latency and IP](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcolumn/2000-09-latency.html) by Geoff Huston, September 2000.
* High latency, but high throughput (i.e. putting data on a disk drive and ship it) examples are Amazon Snowball and [Snowmobile](https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/). Quote: "This secure data truck stores up to 100 PB of data and can help you to move exabytes to AWS in a matter of weeks."
* One can use non-TCP and non-IP protocols like [Internet2](https://internet2.edu/), [ESnet (DOE)](https://www.es.net/), [NSF FABRIC Testbed](https://fabric-testbed.net/), or custom (e.g. [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/category/networking-traffic/)
